// LET

/* This example shows that let variable has a block scope and we can't use it outside */

/* in this example 'a' variable can't reassigned because it's a constant */
const a = [1, 2, 3];

/* 'b' canâ€™t be reassigned, but the value itself that the variable is referencing can be changed if it is mutable value( like an array or object) */

console.log(b); // logs ["a", 2, 3]
